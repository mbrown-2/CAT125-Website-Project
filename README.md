# Components of Website

1. An "About" section dedicated to the purpose of your site.  You may use elements of your personal statement in this section.  

2. A "Links" page referring the viewer to other important sites of interest in your field (6 entries minimum).  

3. An article that reviews and critiques another relevant article, video, or piece of media. You should engage other writers and authors who also discuss aspects of your topic.

4. At least one non-written element you have created/remixed (software, audio, video, or series of self-created images) that deals with your topic. It does not need to function as a stand-alone piece; it may provide additional information within the context of a written article. 

5. There should be at least 6 pages (including the four listed above), which means you should add two more pages/entries of your choosing. These entries/pages can take many forms, but could consist of blog posts, video clips, "how to" pages, a teaching statement, etc.). They just must be relevant to the topic of your website.

6. Each entry should roughly be the equivalent of 500 words (though they may vary by content). Each entry should have a purpose that is communicated clearly and thoroughly, whether through words or other non-written media. 

7. Your site must be live by Wednesday of finals week at 11:59pm (you will submit your website URL on the course website).
